excerpt: 'We introduce *Zebra regression*, a novel streaming regression task. A stream of periodically-created particles travels along a finite, 1-dimensional trajectory, and we observe a stream of sporadic, noisy reports that estimate the location of some particle, but without exact information on which particle is being observed. We seek a streaming clustering algorithm that maintains accurate estimates of the locations of the particles, where a cluster of data reports corresponds to a moving particle.'
