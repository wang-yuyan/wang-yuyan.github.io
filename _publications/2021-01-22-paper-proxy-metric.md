excerpt: 'We use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries to improve the running time of single-linkage and average-linkage, both popular methods for Hierarchical Clustering, for inputs in general metric spaces where ANN techniques may or may not be known. We first propose such a method which works for any general metric space where ANN exists, and then extend it to the more common scenario where an ANN-friendly *proxy* metric is knwon. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical evaluation.'
