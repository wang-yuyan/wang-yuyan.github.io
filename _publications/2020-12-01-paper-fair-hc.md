excerpt: 'Defines fairness in the context of Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and designs algorithm that efficiently produces fair HC solutions for existing objective functions for HC. The proposed fairness is a hard constraint on HC trees. It assigns colors to data points according to their values of a chosen protected feature and imposes that all clusters (apart from leaves) in the HC tree, none of the colors could be overly dominant.'
