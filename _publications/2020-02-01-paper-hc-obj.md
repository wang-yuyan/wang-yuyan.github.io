This paper explores hierarchical clustering on point sets in Euclidean space where l2 distances are used as pairwise dissimilarity scores. The recently introduced objective for points with dissimilarity scores results in every tree being a 1/2 approximation if the distances form a metric. This shows the objective might not make a significant distinction between a good and poor hierarchical clustering in metric spaces. Motivated by this, the paper develops a new global objective for hierarchical clustering in Euclidean space. The objective captures the criterion that has motivated the use of divisive clustering algorithms: that when a split happens, points in the same cluster should be more similar than points in different clusters. This objective gives reasonable results on ground-truth inputs for hierarchical clustering and has a theoretical connection between this objective and the bisecting k-means algorithm.
