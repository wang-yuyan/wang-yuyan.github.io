excerpt: 'Design a new global objective function to measure the quality of Hierarchical Clustering solutions for inputs in Eulidean space and discussed about its theoretical connection to groud-truth inputs and algorithms used in practice. The objective captures the criterion that has motivated the use of divisive clustering algorithms: that when a split happens, points in the same cluster should be more similar than points in different clusters. This objective gives reasonable results on ground-truth inputs for hierarchical clustering and has a theoretical connection between this objective and the bisecting k-means algorithm.'
