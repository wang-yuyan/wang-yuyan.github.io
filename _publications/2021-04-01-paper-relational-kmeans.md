excerpt: 'Given a relational database, we give a constant approximation k-means algorithm that operates directly on the relational input without converting the relational database to the conventional sample-feature matrix input format. Most data encountered by data scientists is stored in relational databases.  Running k-means on a relation database usually requires converting the database into a set of data points, where each data point is a collection of values for different features (attributes). The size of this set could be exponential in the size of the relational database. Our algorithm takes advantage of the highly compact relational representation and achieves a running time that could potentially be sublinear in the number of points the database represents. The algorithm gives a constant approximation of the optimal k-means.'
