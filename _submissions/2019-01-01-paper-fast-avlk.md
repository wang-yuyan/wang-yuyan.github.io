excerpt: 'Average-linkage, one of the most popular hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not scale to large data sets. The fastest known implementation has running time quadratic in the number of data points. This paper presents a technique we call cluster embedding. It maps clusters into points in another Euclidean space with slightly higher dimensions. Further, the distances between the mapped points well approximates the average distance between the clusters. When coupled with nearest-neighbor techniques, this embedding helps us efficiently find close clusters to merge and is used to break the quadratic running time bound. The speed-up is testified both theoretically and empirically.'
